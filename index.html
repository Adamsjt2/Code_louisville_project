        <p>Wren had to go to have a bilateral myringotomy done this last week. It's a very minor, out patient surgery that's also 
            known as having tubes placed in her ears. She was amazing! She barely cried at all.</p>
        <p>She's been doing well taking her ear drops and has falling in love with the little hippo she got at the hospital.</p>
